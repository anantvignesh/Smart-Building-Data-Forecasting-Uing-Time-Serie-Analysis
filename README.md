The objective of the experiment/project is to determine the approach that best fits for this particular dataset in order to plot projection for 1 month in the future from the original data that is one year long.
The objective of the experiment/project is to determine the approach that best fits for this particular dataset in order to plot projection for 1 month in the future from 12/31/2019.
In general, Time Series Analysis can be performed by two different methods in order to forecast future data. These methods are,
Statistical Models such as Holt’s Method(DES), Holt-Winters Method(TES), ARMA, ARIMA, VAR, VARMA, etc.
Recurrent Neural networks such as LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM
In this particular experiment to determine the most optimum model, I’m going to perform tests with both Statistical Models and also with RNNs to find which approach is able to forecast more closely to the actual value.
For this particular dataset that I’ve chosen, I’m going to test, train and evaluate models using the following methods,
Statistical Models
Holt’s Method (Double Exponential Smoothing)
Holt-Winters Method (Triple Exponential Smoothing)
Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
Vector Auto Regression (VAR) to perform Multivariate Time Series Analysis
Recurrent Neural Network Using LSTM to perform Multivariate Time Series Analysis
